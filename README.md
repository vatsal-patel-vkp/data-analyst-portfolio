# Data Analysis Portfolio - Vatsalkumar Patel
## About
This repository is mainly for projects I have done under during my post graduation in Data Analytic for Business.

My preparation for a future as a data analyst comes from the data analytic curriculum at St. Clair College,Canada in  which I learn how to clean and organise data, spot patterns and insights, make meaningful inferences, and effectively convey important findings. As I construct a portfolio of projects, I am becoming more proficient in Excel,Power Query, SQL, Python, R-Programming and its data analysis tools (Numpy, pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras). For the visualization I have strong hands on analytical tools like tableau, PowerBI and also did some other exciting things on Google Analytics. I have also done some case studies and project in project management.

Tips: For data science projects with python, I would recomend you to install numpy , pandas , scipy , scikit learn , matplotlib , seaborn thest basic libraries.

# Portfolio Projects
I will quickly describe each data analytics project in this part, along with the technology stack that was utilised to resolve the issues.

# Projects based on Marketing Analysis 
In the marketing analysis I have done several projects where I have perform the churn prection analysis, customer segementation analysis, sentimnetal analysis using Natural language processing and done some analysis on the customer behviour and product behviour. 
Below is the numbers of project which I have done and there link of the project where it direct you to the project in which detail explanation of the project is given.

***All detail explanation of the project with respect to code and necessary recommendaions is given in the python file which link is provided in each section.***

**Description:** The dataset contians the 50000 records with 12 features of Mobile App data. Here in this dataset our dependent variable is 'Enrolled' which plays important factor in this project. Based on the this features i can analyze the number of user who enrolled in the mobile app with respect to factors like age, numscreen, minigame, premium feature.e project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, filling missing values, EDA (exploratory data analysis), feature engineering.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, Data preprocessing, Data insights, Data visualization, Feature Engineering, Model Building, Feature Scaling.

**Models:** Logistic Regression 

**Performance Measure:** Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

**Result:** Based on the insights it states the specfics groups of user who used the mobile app like younger age customers likley to be enrolled, customer who use to play minigames are more likley to enrolled, which customer going to be enrolled in the last hours of the day as well as for the last day of the week. It also gives information about customer like the app or not based it gives customer are more or less likely to be enrolled. So both the positive and negative about the features in which several reccommendtaion is given based on the negative features.

## Twitter Airline Tweets Sentimental Analysis
**Code:**[Project-Twitter-Tweets-Sentimental-Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/DevkumarPatel21/data-analyst-portfolio/blob/main/Marketing_Analysis/Twitter_Sentimental_Analysis/Project-Twitter-Tweets-Sentimental-Analysis.ipynb)

**Models:** Naive Bayes Model, KNN, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Model and Random Forest.

**Result:** In this project, two features are more important than other and this two features are text and airline_sentiment. Firstly, I have used the stopwords on the comments which eliminate the commomn english words from the comments. Corpus was created which is the collection of the words and I have perform feature extraction method like **Count Vectorizer** and **TF-IDF Vectortizer** before the sentiment is encoded using label encoder. After I have tested this all models with both vectoizer and able compare the best model which proves the findings are correct.
